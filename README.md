# ACDC-OpFlow  
###  Unified, Cross-Language Framework for AC/DC Optimal Power Flow Solutions
Repository with Optimal Power Flow (OPF) library in Julia, Python, MATLAB, and C++ done as a part of the Harmony project (HARMONic stabilitY assessment of PE-penetrated power systems).

Code structure is simple and well-suited for researchers who are just beginning their journey into AC/DC OPF studies.

Detailed information regarding AC/DC OPF problem formulation can be found in [Manual](Readme_ACDC_OPF.pdf).

Further improvements and new features will be added.
